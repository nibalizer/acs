# ACS - AI Code Scaffolding

Ever wanted to run AI coding agents in parallel on the same project? Isolate them to run in docker so you can control what they have access to? Now you can!


## Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/nibalizer/acs
export PATH=${PATH}:/`pwd`/acs/bin
cd <myproject>
acs .
```
